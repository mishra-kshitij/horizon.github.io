      <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my professional journey - an odyssey spanning over 17 years in the dynamic realm of Information Technology, with expertise across multifaceted sectors including Fintech, Credit Lending, Cards, Digital Payments, Government Advisory, and the Aviation Industry. Currently, I've donned the hat of a Fintech Product Manager, innovating a world-class Card Issuing & Authorizing solution. I also take pride in my last stint as a Senior Advisor to the Government of Madhya Pradesh, where I contributed significantly to Digital Transformation, Investment Promotion, Branding, and Marketing Strategy Advisory.</p>
        <p>Educationally, I hold a Post Graduate Diploma in Business Management from Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) and a Bachelor of Commerce & Computers from Barkatullah University. Beyond the boardroom, my love for music fuels my creative side; I have proficiency in guitar and piano, and a penchant for crafting electronic melodies.</p>
        <p>My commitment to continuous learning and personal development has been the compass guiding my professional growth. Leveraging years of domain experience, I now specialize in designing cutting-edge Global Fintech, Payments, Credit Lending, and Card Issuing Solutions.</p>
        <p>My Ham Radio call sign is VU2JDC (Old: VU3PXG), and my handle is Zeda. I genuinely love this hobby as it embarks me on the thrilling journey of operating an Amateur Radio station. I am also a proud Member of The Amateur Radio Society of India (ARSI). This hobby serves as my electronic oasis, allowing me to quench my thirst for knowledge and indulge in captivating experiments. Eager to master the intricate art of Morse Code and delve into the fascinating realm of Digital Modes, I'm ready to amplify my skills and explore the boundless possibilities of amateur radio.</p>
      <h3>Previous Experiences</h3>
        <p>Beyond corporate realms, I played a pivotal role as a senior government advisor & knowledge partner in mega investment promotion summits such as the 'Global Investors Summit (GIS),' 'Magnificent Madhya Pradesh (MMP2019),' and 'The World Economic Forum (WEF).' Additionally, I've been actively involved in round-table conferences, exemplified by the Invest MP Roundtable meets. My responsibilities extended to overseeing critical knowledge content and collateral creation activities, including the quarterly iMPact Newsletter, State Sector Profiles, Industrial Area Profiles, and a plethora of digital content for the State's 'Single Window Portal'.</p>
        <p>Embarking on my career at American Express, I served as a Lead Business Analyst, Master Credit Analyst, and Senior CCP for the Corporate Large Market Segment. Here, I honed skills crucial to pivotal projects in my professional trajectory. Originating in the aviation industry, I mastered best-in-class service deliveries, teamwork, effective communication, safety & emergency handling, and team management, all while adhering rigorously to DGCA-compliant aviation regulations and procedures.</p>
        <p>In essence, my journey is a testament to the fusion of strategic acumen, technological prowess, and a passion for creativity & innovation. As I continue to orchestrate solutions at the intersection of technology and finance, I remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the ever-evolving landscape of Information Technology!</p>
