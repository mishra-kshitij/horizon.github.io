# Personal Web Projects & Utilities

This repository contains the source code for my personal static website and a collection of web-based tools, experiments, and utilities hosted via **GitHub Pages**.

The site serves as a lightweight, fast, and self-hosted platform for showcasing projects, interactive tools, and experiments across technology, amateur radio, and creative computing.
